every word in the phrase. Given the following input,

the output will be

            Causal learning depends on a model and data
    Causal learning depends on a model and data
                                       Causal learning depends on a model and data
Causal learning depends on a model and data
                       Causal learning depends on a model and data
                                Causal learning depends on a model and data
          Causal learning depends on a model and data
