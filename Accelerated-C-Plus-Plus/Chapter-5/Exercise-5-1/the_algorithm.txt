The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:
    1. Read each line of the input and generate a set of rotations of that line.
    2. Sort the rotations.
    3. Unrotate and write the permuted index.
The main steps are to be expanded in the following lines.

1. Read each line of the input and generate a set of rotations of that line.
Each line is to be read and stored in a list. Let a function be defined. Its inputs are a reference to a stream and a reference to a list of strings. Its output is a reference to a stream. Using this function, the lines can be read. After reading the lines, their rotations can be produced by means of a function whose input is a constant reference to the list of the lines and whose output is a reference to a list of a structure. This structure contains the rotated line and the initial word of the original line. These two functions and the structure are to be declared in a header file. The functions are to be defined in a cpp source file.
