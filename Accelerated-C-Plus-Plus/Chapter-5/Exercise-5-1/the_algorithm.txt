The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:
    1. Read each line of the input and generate a set of rotations of that line.
    2. Sort the rotations.
    3. Unrotate and write the permuted index.
The main steps are to be expanded in the following lines.

1. Read each line of the input and generate a set of rotations of that line.
Each line is to be read and stored in a list. This can be achieved by defining a function whose input is an input stream and whose output is a list of the lines read. After reading the lines, the production of the rotations of those lines is to be done by means of a function whose input is the list of the lines and whose output is the list of a structure. This structure contains the rotated line and the initial word of the original line. These two functions are to be declared in a header file and defined in a cpp source file.
