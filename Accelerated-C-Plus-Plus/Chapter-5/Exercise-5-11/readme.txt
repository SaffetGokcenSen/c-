Explanation
In text processing it is sometimes useful to know whether a word has any 
ascenders or descenders. Ascenders are the parts of lowercase letters that 
extend above the text line; in the English alphabet, the letters b, d, f, h, k, 
l, and t have ascenders. Similarly, the descenders are the parts of lowercase 
letters that descend below the line; In English, the letters g, j, p, q, and y 
have descenders. This program determines whether a word has any ascenders or 
descenders.
