Explanation
The template function replace on the page 147 of the book is implemented. The 
user is prompted for the random entry of either of the letters 'a', 'b' or 'c' 
separated by newlines. Then, 'a' is replaced with 'z', 'b' is replaced with 'y' 
and 'c' is replaced with 'x'. The replaced letters are printed.
