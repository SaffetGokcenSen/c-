Explanation
This program implements the library algorithm copy(b, e, d). The algorithm 
copies the values in the sequence denoted by the input iterators b and e into 
the destination indicated by output iterator d. The algorithm assumes that enough 
space exists in the destination to hold the values being copied. It returns a 
value that denotes a position one past the last destination element.
