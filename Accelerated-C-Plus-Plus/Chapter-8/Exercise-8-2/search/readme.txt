Explanation

Implements the search algorithm

search(b, e, b2, e2)

Returns a forward iterator positioned on the first occurrence, in the sequence 
denoted by the forward iterators b and e, of the subsequence denoted by the 
forward iterators b2 and e2.

Two sample screen shots from the implementation's output are as follows:

In the first line of your input, please enter a sequence of characters separated
by blank spaces. In the second line of your input, please enter a sequence of 
characters shorter than the first sequence. After entering the second sequence, 
please quit your input with the end-of-file character which is ctrl+d in linux.
a b c 1 c h 3 2
h 3 2
The elements of the first sequence are as follows:
a
b
c
1
c
h
3
2
The elements of the second sequence are as follows:
h
3
2
The element before the starting point of the sequence is as follows:
c
The last element of the sequence is the same as that of the bigger sequence
